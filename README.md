This repository contains code for my ENGN4200 Honours Project. This project aims answer the research question:

_“Can onboard Machine Learning be utilized on microcontrollers to create a musical interface?”_

 This interface will be evaluated based on its expressiveness, practicality and its performance capabilities. The project has the following objectives.
 
	1. Understand the fundamentals of music Interfaces and interactive machine learning
	2. Develop an understanding of TensorFlow lite and onboard machine learning on microcontrollers
	3. Develop a prototype music interface on microcontroller
	4. Apply the new music interface in a musical performance

This code will be compatible with a Teensy 4.0 microprocessor and the Audio Adapter board Revision D.
The interface will use HID compatible gaming controllers such as but not limited to
the Thrustmaster T16000m HOTAS and an Xbox One controller.

Folders named __music_XXXX__ contain Arduino code for different interfaces using the Teensy
microprocessor and different types of game controllers
